Now, you can also collaborate with AI using Gemini for Google Workspace to help boost your productivity and \\ncreativity without sacrificing privacy or security. The embedded generative AI-powered features can help you \\nwrite, organize information, create images, accelerate workflows, have richer meetings, and much more, all \\nwhile using your favorite apps like Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Meet, Google \\nSlides, and Gemini Advanced (the standalone chat experience available at gemini.google.com with enterprise-\\ngrade security). Gemini is accessible right where you are doing your work — with access to your personal \\nknowledge base in Drive, Docs, Gmail, and more — so you can enhance and create powerful workflows across \\nthe Workspace apps with less tab switching and interruption. This guide provides you with the foundational skills to write effective prompts when using Gemini for Workspace. You can think of a prompt as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several \\nprompts as the conversation progresses.

You can think of a prompt as a conversation starter with your AI-powered assistant. You might write several \\nprompts as the conversation progresses. While the possibilities are virtually endless, you can put consistent \\nbest practices to work today. The four main areas to consider when writing an effective prompt are:\\n•  Persona \\n•  Task \\n•  Context \\n•  Format \\n \\nHere is an example of a prompt using all four areas that could work well in Gmail and Google Docs: \\n You are a program manager in [industry]. Draft an executive summary email to  [persona] based on [details \\n about relevant program docs]. Limit to bullet points. You don’t need to use all four in every prompt, but using a few will help! Always remember to include a verb or \\ncommand as part of your task; this is the most important component of a prompt. Contact sales to get started with \\nGemini for Workspace today. 3\\nHere are quick tips to get you started with Gemini for Google Workspace: \\n1. Use natural language. Write as if you’re speaking to another person. Express complete thoughts in  \\nfull sentences. 2. Be specific and iterate. Tell Gemini what you need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone, create). Provide as much context as possible. 3. Be concise and avoid complexity.', 'Express complete thoughts in  \\nfull sentences. 2. Be specific and iterate. Tell Gemini what you need it to do (summarize, write, change the tone, create). Provide as much context as possible. 3. Be concise and avoid complexity. State your request in brief — but specific — language. Avoid jargon. 4. Make it a conversation. Fine-tune your prompts if the results don’t meet your expectations or if you believe \\nthere’s room for improvement. Use follow-up prompts and an iterative process of review and refinement to \\nyield better results. 5. Use your documents. Personalize Gemini’s output with information from your own files in Google Drive. 6. Make Gemini your prompt editor. When using Gemini Advanced, start your prompts with: “Make this a \\npower prompt: [original prompt text here].” Gemini will make suggestions on how to improve your prompt. Ensure it says what you need, and then paste it back into Gemini Advanced to get an output. Prompting is a skill we can all learn. You don’t have to be a prompt \\nengineer to use generative AI. However, you will likely need to try a few \\ndifferent approaches for your prompt if you don’t get your desired \\noutcome the first time. Based on what we’ve learned from our users \\nso far, the most fruitful prompts average around 21 words with relevant \\ncontext, yet the prompts people try are usually less than nine words.', 'However, you will likely need to try a few \\ndifferent approaches for your prompt if you don’t get your desired \\noutcome the first time.

Generative AI and all of its possibilities are exciting, but it’s still new. Even \\nthough our models are getting better every day, prompts can sometimes \\nhave unpredictable responses. Before putting an output from Gemini for Workspace into action, review it \\nto ensure clarity, relevance, and accuracy. And of course, keep the most \\nimportant thing in mind: Generative AI is meant to help humans but the \\nfinal output is yours.

This means the apps you know and use will work \\ntogether smoothly so you can collaborate with Gemini right where you are. You can have fewer interruptions to \\nyour focus and workflow, helping you complete tasks and do things you might not have initially known how to do. You can access the features of Gemini for Workspace in multiple ways. Engaging with Gemini in the side panel \\nof your Workspace apps allows you to create highly personalized generative AI outputs that are based on your \\nown files and documents — even if they aren’t Google Docs. You can generate personalized emails in seconds \\nreferencing your own Docs to pull in relevant context, generate Slides that are based on information directly  \\nfrom your own briefs or reports, and so much more.', 'Engaging with Gemini in the side panel \\nof your Workspace apps allows you to create highly personalized generative AI outputs that are based on your \\nown files and documents — even if they aren’t Google Docs.

Other prompts are presented without variables highlighted to \\nshow you what a full prompt could look like. All of the prompts in this guide are \\nmeant to inspire you, but ultimately they will need to be customized to help you \\nwith your specific work.
